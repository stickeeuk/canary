# stickee Canary

Linting and analysing tools for PHP projects.

## Installation

```
mkdir -p tools/canary
composer require --dev --working-dir=tools/canary stickee/canary
tools/canary/vendor/bin/canary install
```

You must commit this new directory and any new config files.

_[Why do we install tools into their own directory?](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer#installation)_

## Usage

```
tools/canary/vendor/bin/canary
```

### Commands

Canary is simply a wrapper for a bunch of tools.

You can still call them directly.

### `analyse`

[PHPStan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan)

```
vendor/bin/canary analyse
```

This command will perform static-analysis of your whole project.

It _should_ be ran as part of the `pre-commit` hook.

PHPStan can be ran using:
```
tools/canary/vendor/bin/phpstan <COMMAND> -c vendor/stickee/canary/dist/phpstan.dist.neon
```

See [stickee/larastan-config](https://github.com/stickeeuk/larastan-config) for more details.

### `fix`

[PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer)

```
vendor/bin/canary fix
```

This command will attempt to fix minor code style issues.

It _can_ be ran against a single file.

It _should_ be ran against staged files as part of the `pre-commit` hook.

PHP-CS-Fixer can be ran using:

```
tools/canary/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer <COMMAND> --config vendor/stickee/canary/dist/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php
```

See [stickee/php-cs-fixer-config](https://github.com/stickeeuk/php-cs-fixer-config) for more details.

### `suggest`

[Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) in `--dry-run` mode

```
vendor/bin/canary suggest
```

This command will suggest improvements as diffs in the terminal.

Any `suggest`ed improvements must be performed manually or you can run the `improve` command to do it for you.

See [stickee/rector-config](https://github.com/stickeeuk/rector-config) for more details.

### `improve`

[Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector)

```
vendor/bin/canary improve
```

This command will refactor your code in an attempt to improve it.

Any `improve`d code **must** be checked before committing.

It _can_ be ran against a single file.

It should **not** be ran as part of the `pre-commit` hook.

See [stickee/rector-config](https://github.com/stickeeuk/rector-config) for more details.

#### Note

You _may_ find it useful to add these `improve`ments as patches with Git.

You could use a Git integration in your editor or stage the `improve`ments as patches with:

```
git add <file> -p
```
